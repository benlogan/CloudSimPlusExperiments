# this is the legacy template format that we've been using to specify simulation infra

# this is basically 1 VM per host and 1 cloudlet per host/vm. 100 hosts and 100 cloudlets, so everything running in parallel

# workload length is -1, so all run continuously until they are interrupted on the 1 hour mark

  # 1000 every 1 second results in too many cloudlets to log easily!
  # 500 every 1 second is roughly 50% capacity
  # needs an end time!?
