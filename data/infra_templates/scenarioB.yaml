# this is the legacy template format that we've been using to specify simulation infra

# this is basically 1 VM per host and 1 cloudlet per host/vm. 100 hosts and 100 cloudlets, so everything running in parallel

# workload length is -1, so all run continuously until they are interrupted on the 1 hour mark
