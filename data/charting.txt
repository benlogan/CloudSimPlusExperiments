Charting Process;

copy the raw data from the csv

paste into excel

'text to columns' (delimitered on ';')

too many points to plot (unless you reduce sampling frequency)...

pivot table (on selected rows/columns)

rows = time
values = average of host

then the key thing - group by 1000s (right click anywhere in time column)

create standard line chart

add trendline (show average)

show two different series/scale
e.g. utilisation on left, cumulative work done on right
